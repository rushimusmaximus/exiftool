/**
 * Provide a Java-like interface to Phil Harvey's excellent, Perl-based <a
 * href="http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool">ExifToolNew3</a>.
 * <p/>
 * Initial work done by "Riyad Kalla" software@thebuzzmedia.com.
 * <p/>
 * There are a number of other basic Java wrappers to ExifToolNew3 available online, but most of them only abstract out
 * the actual Java-external-process execution logic and do no additional work to make integration with the external
 * ExifToolNew3 any easier or intuitive from the perspective of the Java application written to make use of
 * ExifToolNew3.
 * <p/>
 * This class was written in order to make integration with ExifToolNew3 inside of a Java application seamless and
 * performant with the goal being that the developer can treat ExifToolNew3 as if it were written in Java, garnering all
 * of the benefits with none of the added headache of managing an external native process from Java.
 * <p/>
 * Phil Harvey's ExifToolNew3 is written in Perl and runs on all major platforms (including Windows) so no portability
 * issues are introduced into your application by utilizing this class.
 * <h3>Usage</h3>
 * Assuming ExifToolNew3 is installed on the host system correctly and either in the system path or pointed to by
 * {@link #ENV_EXIF_TOOL_PATH}, using this class to communicate with ExifToolNew3 is as simple as creating an instance (
 * <code>ExifToolNew3 tool = new ExifToolNew3()</code>) and then making calls to
 * {@link #getImageMeta7(java.io.File,ReadOptions, Object...)} (optionally supplying tags or
 * {@link #writeMetadata(WriteOptions,java.io.File, java.util.Map)}
 * <p/>
 * In this default mode methods will automatically start an external ExifToolNew3 process to handle the request. After
 * ExifToolNew3 has parsed the tag values from the file, the external process exits and this class parses the result
 * before returning it to the caller.
 * <p/>
 * <h3>ExifToolNew3 -stay_open Support</h3>
 * ExifToolNew3 <a href= "http://u88.n24.queensu.ca/exiftool/forum/index.php/topic,1402.msg12933.html#msg12933"
 * >8.36</a> added a new persistent-process feature that allows ExifToolNew3 to stay running in a daemon mode and
 * continue accepting commands via a file or stdin.
 * <p/>
 * This new mode is controlled via the <code>-stay_open True/False</code> command line argument and in a busy system
 * that is making thousands of calls to ExifToolNew3, can offer speed improvements of up to <strong>60x</strong> (yes,
 * really that much).
 * <p/>
 * This feature was added to ExifToolNew3 shortly after user <a href="http://www.christian-etter.de/?p=458">Christian
 * Etter discovered</a> the overhead for starting up a new Perl interpreter each time ExifToolNew3 is loaded accounts
 * for roughly <a href= "http://u88.n24.queensu.ca/exiftool/forum/index.php/topic,1402.msg6121.html#msg6121" >98.4% of
 * the total runtime</a>.
 * <p/>
 * Support for using ExifToolNew3 in daemon mode is enabled by passing {@link Feature#STAY_OPEN} to the constructor of
 * the class when creating an instance of this class and then simply using the class as you normally would. This class
 * will manage a single ExifToolNew3 process running in daemon mode in the background to service all future calls to the
 * class.
 * <p/>
 * Because this feature requires ExifToolNew3 8.36 or later, this class will actually verify support for the feature in
 * the version of ExifToolNew3 pointed at by {@link #ENV_EXIF_TOOL_PATH} before successfully instantiating the class and
 * will notify you via an {@link UnsupportedFeatureException} if the native ExifToolNew3 doesn't support the requested
 * feature.
 * <p/>
 * In the event of an {@link UnsupportedFeatureException}, the caller can either upgrade the native ExifToolNew3 upgrade
 * to the version required or simply avoid using that feature to work around the exception.
 * <h3>Automatic Resource Cleanup</h3>
 * When {@link Feature#STAY_OPEN} mode is used, there is the potential for leaking both host OS processes (native
 * 'exiftool' processes) as well as the read/write streams used to communicate with it unless {@link #close()} is called
 * to clean them up when done. <strong>Fortunately</strong>, this class provides an automatic cleanup mechanism that
 * runs, by default, after 10mins of inactivity to clean up those stray resources.
 * <p/>
 * The inactivity period can be controlled by modifying the {@link #ENV_EXIF_TOOL_PROCESSCLEANUPDELAY} system variable.
 * A value of <code>0</code> or less disabled the automatic cleanup process and requires you to cleanup ExifToolNew3
 * instances on your own by calling {@link #close()} manually.
 * <p/>
 * Any class activity by way of calls to <code>getImageMeta</code> will always reset the inactivity timer, so in a busy
 * system the cleanup thread could potentially never run, leaving the original host ExifToolNew3 process running forever
 * (which is fine).
 * <p/>
 * This design was chosen to help make using the class and not introducing memory leaks and bugs into your code easier
 * as well as making very inactive instances of this class light weight while not in-use by cleaning up after
 * themselves.
 * <p/>
 * The only overhead incurred when opening the process back up is a 250-500ms lag while launching the VM interpreter
 * again on the first call (depending on host machine speed and load).
 * <h3>Reusing a "closed" ExifToolNew3 Instance</h3>
 * If you or the cleanup thread have called {@link #close()} on an instance of this class, cleaning up the host process
 * and read/write streams, the instance of this class can still be safely used. Any followup calls to
 * <code>getImageMeta</code> will simply re-instantiate all the required resources necessary to service the call
 * (honoring any {@link Feature}s set).
 * <p/>
 * This can be handy behavior to be aware of when writing scheduled processing jobs that may wake up every hour and
 * process thousands of pictures then go back to sleep. In order for the process to execute as fast as possible, you
 * would want to use ExifToolNew3 in daemon mode (pass {@link Feature#STAY_OPEN} to the constructor of this class) and
 * when done, instead of {@link #close()}-ing the instance of this class and throwing it out, you can keep the reference
 * around and re-use it again when the job executes again an hour later.
 * <h3>Performance</h3>
 * Extra care is taken to ensure minimal object creation or unnecessary CPU overhead while communicating with the
 * external process.
 * <p/>
 * {@link Pattern}s used to split the responses from the process are explicitly compiled and reused, string
 * concatenation is minimized, Tag name lookup is done via a <code>static final</code> {@link Map} shared by all
 * instances and so on.
 * <p/>
 * Additionally, extra care is taken to utilize the most optimal code paths when initiating and using the external
 * process, for example, the {@link ProcessBuilder#command(List)} method is used to avoid the copying of array elements
 * when {@link ProcessBuilder#command(String...)} is used and avoiding the (hidden) use of {@link StringTokenizer} when
 * {@link Runtime#exec(String)} is called.
 * <p/>
 * All of this effort was done to ensure that imgscalr and its supporting classes continue to provide best-of-breed
 * performance and memory utilization in long running/high performance environments (e.g. web applications).
 * <h3>Thread Safety</h3>
 * Instances of this class are <strong>not</strong> Thread-safe. Both the instance of this class and external
 * ExifToolNew3 process maintain state specific to the current operation. Use of instances of this class need to be
 * synchronized using an external mechanism or in a highly threaded environment (e.g. web application), instances of
 * this class can be used along with {@link ThreadLocal}s to ensure Thread-safe, highly parallel use.
 * <h3>Why ExifToolNew3?</h3>
 * <a href="http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool">ExifToolNew3</a> is written in Perl and requires an external
 * process call from Java to make use of.
 * <p/>
 * While this would normally preclude a piece of software from inclusion into the imgscalr library (more complex
 * integration), there is no other image metadata piece of software available as robust, complete and well-tested as
 * ExifToolNew3. In addition, ExifToolNew3 already runs on all major platforms (including Windows), so there was not a
 * lack of portability introduced by providing an integration for it.
 * <p/>
 * Allowing it to be used from Java is a boon to any Java project that needs the ability to read/write image-metadata
 * from almost <a href="http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/#supported">any image or video file</a> format.
 * <h3>Alternatives</h3>
 * If integration with an external Perl process is something your app cannot do and you still need image
 * metadata-extraction capability, Drew Noakes has written the 2nd most robust image metadata library I have come
 * across: <a href="http://drewnoakes.com/drewnoakes.com/code/exif/">Metadata Extractor</a> that you might want to look
 * at.
